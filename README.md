# 📦 Business Supply Express – Database Systems Project

**Business Supply Express** is a database-driven delivery system designed to track users and product logistics. Developed using **SQL** and **MySQL Workbench**, this project focuses on creating a scalable, relational data model using an Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EERD), efficient schema design, and performance-oriented stored procedures.

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `EERD/` – Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram of the system  
- `schema/` – SQL scripts to create and initialize the database schema  
- `stored_procedures/` – SQL scripts for stored procedures to automate key operations  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SQL**
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **EERD (Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram)**

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔧 **EERD Modeling**: Designed a detailed Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram to represent key entities and relationships  
- 🧩 **Relational Schema**: Built normalized schemas to reflect the EERD and enforce data integrity  
- ⚙️ **Stored Procedures**: Implemented optimized stored procedures to streamline complex database operations
