# Business Supply Express ‚Äì Database Systems Project

**Business Supply Express** is a database-driven delivery system designed to track users and product logistics. Developed using **SQL** and **MySQL Workbench**, this project focuses on creating a scalable, relational data model using an Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EERD), efficient schema design, and performance-oriented stored procedures.

## Repository Structure

- `EERD/` ‚Äì Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram of the system  
- `schema/` ‚Äì SQL scripts to create and initialize the database schema  
- `stored_procedures/` ‚Äì SQL scripts for stored procedures to automate key operations
